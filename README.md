# Craps
A C# console application that allows you to bet on a game of craps. The application generates random numbers to simulate the roll of dice and allows you to play until you're balance reaches zero (the player starts with $1,000).

Ignore the "Wager" class. I published the app to my Github app on my desktop before I realized that didn't need to be there. Even though I deleted it from the app, Github stayed true to my initial commit...
